1. Please share a sample of some code you’ve written or contributed to, that is a good reflection of your programming skill.  Github link(s) would be ideal.  If you're up for writing some fresh code, please take a shot at this programming challenge: https://github.com/replicatedcom/core-challenge-troubleshoot-analyzers

2. Please share a sample of some technical writing you’ve done, particularly if you have something published -- a blog post, design document, block comments from code, etc...

3. Please share a sample of analysis - for example, a bug report, threat modeling, performance-tuning analysis, or a war story about a security incident or a production outage.

4. What is an example of something that you learned that was a struggle for you?

5. Who is someone who has mentored you, and what did you learn from them?
> DKG was a jerk. He was crass, irreverent and stubborn. He wasn't always right, but when he was he'd make sure you knew it. I hated him right up until I joined another team and all of a sudden I realized he had made it possible for me to work with literally anyone. The miserable experience he provided was so much more challenging intellectually and emotionally than anything I have faced since. He taught me how to check my ego at the door, patiently wade through the noise, find what looked like value and finally test that to ensure success. 

6. Who is someone you have mentored, and what did you learn from them?
> David 

7. What qualities do you most admire in other software engineers?
> Candidness, eloquence and empathy (understanding the users needs)

8. Describe some of the more interesting differences between two programming languages you know.
> This may be clichè, but Golang's lack of classes is terribly refreshing. 


9.  Describe a new feature that was added to a programming language/library/framework/tool that you use, and how you decided whether to adopt and use this new feature or not.
> Python's `f-strings`- I avoided using the `str.format()` and prefered the original _hack_ of using the operator `%`. It always felt more concise and dare I say _pythonic_. Enter `f-strings`, this was the most natural transition for me. I liked how it matched the pattern established by `r-strings`, `u-strings` and `b-strings`.

1.  Consider the following scenario:  You are the newest member of a team, working on a new service that consists of several code repositories and their build/test/deployment configurations.  It’s late in the day, and a coworker asks you to code review their most recent pull request, and it’s a big one with lots of changes.  You pull their branch to test it out, and the code just doesn’t work.  You let the coworker know, and they tell you “Sorry, it’s working fine on my computer, and I need to head out, can we revisit tomorrow?”.  The next day, you do a ‘pull’ on this branch, and you don’t see any new commits, but the code is now working fine.  What are some of the things you’d do next, and why?
